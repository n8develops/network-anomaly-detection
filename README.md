# network-anomaly-detection
Cyberattacks often create unusual network behavior. This project involves building a machine learning model that detects network anomalies using datasets like NSL-KDD or CIC-IDS2017. Using Python with Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow, you can train a classifier to distinguish between normal and malicious traffic.
